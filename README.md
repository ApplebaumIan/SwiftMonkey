# SwiftMonkey

This is a framework for generating randomised user input in iOS
apps. This kind of monkey testing is useful for stress-testing
apps and finding rare crashes.

There is a related project, [SwiftMonkeyPaws][], which provides
visualisation of the generated events. This greatly increases
the usefulness of the randomised testing, as you can see what
touches caused any crash you may encounter.

### Requirements

SwiftMonkey uses Swift 3.0. It has no other dependencies
other than iOS itself. Pairing it with the [SwiftMonkeyPaws][]
framework is a good idea, but not required.

### Usage

To be written.
