# SwiftMonkeyExample

This is an example project to demonstrate the use of the
[SwiftMonkey][] and [SwiftMonkeyPaws][] monkey testing
frameworks.

### Requirements

All the SwiftMonkey projects use Swift 3.0. This example uses
[SwiftMonkey][] and [SwiftMonkeyPaws][], both of which are
included in the repo. There are no other external dependencies.

### Usage

Open the `xcodeproj`, then press `Cmd-U` to run the tests. This
will start the monkey test and let you see how it works.

### TODO

- Add more UI elements, views and controls to make the example
  look more interesting.
- Maybe add some actual crashes that the monkey testing can find?
